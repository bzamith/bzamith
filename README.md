### Hi there 👋
My name is **Bruna** 🙆‍♀️ , I'm a BSc. in Computer Engineering, MSc. in AI and working as a Data Scientist II at Amazon 💻 , in the Latam ML team. 

Since 2015, I've been developing research as part of the [Bioinformatics and Machine Learning group (BioMaL)](http://www.biomal.ufscar.br/), from [Federal University of Sao Carlos (UFSCar)](https://www.ufscar.br/) 🇧🇷 . I've obtained my Masters degree at this same group. 

My research interests lie in the application of Machine Learning in Natural Sciences 🌱. Besides that, I am passionate and continuously learning about Software Engineering, Distributed Systems and Natural Computing. 

You can visit my [portfolio](http://bzamith.github.io/) to get an overview of my recent projects and topics that I am studying.

Also, feel free to reach out to me via my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bruna-zamith/) 💬
