### Hi there 👋
My name is **Bruna** 🙆‍♀️ , I am a BSc in Computer Engineering, working as a Software Engineer II at Amazon 💻 , in the International Technology Expansion team. 

Since 2021, I'm pursuing my Masters degree at [Federal University of Sao Carlos (UFSCar)](https://www.ufscar.br/) 🇧🇷 , working in the [Bioinformatics and Machine Learning group (BioMaL)](http://www.biomal.ufscar.br/). My research interests lie in the application of Machine Learning in the Natural Sciences 🌱.

I am passionate and continuously learning about Data Science and Bioinformatics. Still, I am really looking forward to learning more about Computer Networks and Natural Computing.
